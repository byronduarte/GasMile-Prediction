# GasMile-Prediction
Abstract

Predict whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage.

We want to predict whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage based 7 car attributes such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year and origin. This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition

This data set consists of records for 392 cars manufactured between 1970 and 1982. Their weights vary between 1613 and 5140 lbs, their horsepower vary between 46 and 230, and their displacement vary between 68 and 455. 245 of these cars were manufactured in the USA, 68 in Asia and 79 in Europe. Each record consist of 8 variables: mpg01 (millage per gallon of gas (high or low)), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year and origin.
